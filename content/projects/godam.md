[**godam (Godot Asset Manager)**](https://github.com/nilsiker/godam) is an unofficial minimal command-line tool to manage assets from the Godot Asset Library.

A command-line tool that aims to operate in the same way the Godot Editor downloads and installs assets from the Godot Asset Library.

The objective is to allow developers to fully omit addons from their VCS, and keep track of them using a declarative configuration file (similar to Cargo.toml or package.json)
